Hello this is Mark speaking, I have created my first file in my repository
I kinda do not have much of an idea (as of 12/1/2022) as to what to do and I am a little overwhelmed
Hoping this will be fine however, as time goes by.

Mark here, as of 1st of June 2022 (01/06/2022), I am able to use Git and Github
in a more understandable fashion, and proves very useful to storing and updating my files whilst
keeping track of previous versions (Able to use Git through Powershell/Cmd, and Intellij)
