Hello this is Mark speaking, I have created my first file in my repository
I kinda do not have much of an idea (as of 12/1/2022 - dd/mm/yyyy) as to what to do and I am a little overwhelmed
Hoping this will be fine however, as time goes by.

Mark here, as of 1st of June 2022, I am able to use Git and Github
in a more understandable fashion, and proves very useful to storing and updating my files whilst
keeping track of previous versions (Able to use Git through Powershell/Cmd, and Intellij)

It's ya boi, Mj√∏rk, 26th of October 2022, I have acquired some more experience regarding
the branching system, merging, pull requests, etc., due to being exposed to couple of more projects at uni. Very fun
to utilise this to keep track of my project files and having a storage that is not my disk drives. Nearing the end of this year
feeling quite happy that I've been able to learn so much of something that had overwhelmed me for quite a while (still does in some aspects lol).

Hello hello, yearly doc time (22/08/2023), 2 years into "Computer and Data Science" and I'm using `git` more than ever
as well as cultivating my commits and protifolio, not too many additions to my usage of git, fairly minute, but looking back from last year
definitely have gained a ton of knowledge :)
